        The criminal justice system can't support safe, whole communities without feedback on what’s working and what’s
        not. We stitch together data from fragmented systems to provide decision-makers with the information they need
        to
        improve outcomes. With this data, we surface opportunities to safely chart a path to a smaller system, and to
        track the impact of policy and practice changes over time.
